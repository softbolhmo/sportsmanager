-make Session String more bullet proof: it's ugly when there's just the sport
-create required fields
	-if html() == '', put cell in red and prevent switching tab
	-max # of characters e.g. season => varchar(5)
-slug authorized characters! remove spaces...
	-when name is saved, if slug == '' => convert name to slug function()
-change "games" stat to "games_played"
	-maybe... this would fuck up all the baseball stats
-when session is set and new row added, automatically place session params in new row
	-add_row response should be like {id: '#', sport: 'baseball', season: '2013'}
	-there should be a $.parseJSON(response) made
-add_stats by sports
	-make it prettier
	-add more stats
	-add more sports
-uniformiser functions/ajax.php
-create standard classes: meta_box, post_typerole, taxonomy, user_meta_box
-inner filter pages don't shoe up in IE7: js error? jQuery slide down?
